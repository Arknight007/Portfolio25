### Core Components

1. **Terminal**: The main interface component that processes user commands and displays appropriate sections
2. **Boot Sequence**: Simulates a system boot-up with animated text

4. **Section Components**: Individual content sections (About, Skills, Projects, etc.)
5. **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements like buttons, cards, and toggles

### Data Flow

1. User enters commands in the Terminal component
2. Commands are processed and matched to corresponding sections
3. Appropriate section components are rendered with their content
4. User can navigate between sections using commands or navigation buttons
